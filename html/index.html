            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                With the proliferation of workplace computers in the early 1990s, 
                user experience started to become a positive insight for designers. 
                Donald Norman, a professor and researcher in design, usability, 
                and cognitive science, coined the term "user experience," 
                and brought it to a wider audience.
            </p>

            <p>
                There is a debate occurring in the experience design community 
                regarding its focus, provoked in part by design scholar 
                and practitioner, Don Norman. Norman claims that when 
                designers describe people only as customers, consumers, 
                and users, designers risk diminishing their ability to do 
                good design.
            </p>

            <h2>Elements</h2>
            <p>
                User experience design draws from design approaches like 
                human-computer interaction and user-centered design, 
                and includes elements from similar disciplines like 
                interaction design, visual design, information architecture, 
                user research, and others.
            </p>

            <h2>Deliverables</h2>
            <p>
                UX designers perform a number of different tasks and therefore use 
                a range of deliverables to communicate their design ideas and 
                research findings to stakeholders. Regarding UX specification 
                documents, these requirements depend on the client or the 
                organization involved in designing a product.
            </p>

            <p>
                The four major deliverables are: a title page, an introduction to the feature, 
                wireframes, and a version history. Depending on the type of 
                project, the specification documents can also include flow models, 
                cultural models, personas, user stories, scenarios and any 
                prior user research.
